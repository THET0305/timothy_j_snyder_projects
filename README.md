# Project Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal project portfolio site.

The site showcases videos of shipped work projects alongside links to personal and experimental builds. It serves as a central place to document what I’ve built, how I approach problems, and the kinds of systems I enjoy working on.

## Focus

My work centers around emerging technologies, where rapid prototyping, iteration, and problem-solving under uncertainty are essential. I tend to work closest to the implementation layer, building systems that can be tested, evolved, and validated quickly.

I’m a homeschooler through and through, and I learn best by applying concepts directly in real systems rather than studying them in isolation. This portfolio reflects that hands-on, build-first approach.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Short videos demonstrating completed or in-progress work projects
- Links to personal GitHub repositories and experiments
- Technical prototypes, tools, and systems explorations
- Notes and documentation where context adds value

Not all projects are polished products. Many are explorations, proofs of concept, or focused experiments intended to answer specific technical questions.

## Tech Stack

The site itself is intentionally simple and static, built to load fast and stay easy to maintain.

- GitHub Pages
- HTML / CSS
- No build step or framework dependencies

Individual projects may use a wide range of technologies, which are documented alongside each project.

## Live Site

The portfolio is hosted via GitHub Pages:
